## ðŸš€ Welcome to Fabra!

Fabra exposes a RESTful API to help companies build customer-facing data
warehouse integrations. Through our API, you can configure your own internal
destinations and your customers' data sources, define the objects your customers
can send to you, initiate syncs, and much more.
