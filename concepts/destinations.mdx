## What is a Destination?

**Destinations** are where Fabra will *send* the data that we've pulled from a Source. Fabra supports many
different destinations, including data warehouses like BigQuery, Snowflake and Redshift, operational databases
like PostgreSQL and MySQL, object stores like S3 and Cloud Storage, and your own custom webhook endpoints.

## Connecting a Destination
The easiest way to setup a new Destination is to use Fabra's [Admin Panel](https://app.fabra.io). Navigate to the
Destinations tab on the side navigation bar, and click **New Destination** in the top right of the page.

<Note>
You can also use Fabra's API to create Destinations instead. Check out our
[API docs](https://docs.fabra.io/api-reference/create-destination) to learn more.

## Webhook Destinations

You can configure Fabra to send your customer's data to your own **custom webhook** instead of loading data directly into a data warehouse.
To do so, Fabra will make a `POST` request to the webhook URL you enter when setting up the webhook destination with the following
payload structure:
```json
{
    "end_customer_id": 1,
    "object_webhook_id": 2, // configured when creating the object in Fabra
    "data": [
        {
            // these fields are configured when creating the object
            "object_field_1": "abc",
            "object_field_2": 1200,
            "object_field_3": ["list", "of", "anything"],
            "object_field_3": {"key": "value"},
            ...
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

The `data` field will be limited to a maximum length of 10,000 records per-request. For updates exceeding this limit (including the initial sync),
Fabra will make multiple calls to your webhook.
