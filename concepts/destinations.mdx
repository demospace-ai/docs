## What is a Destination?

**Destinations** are where Fabra will *send* the data that we've pulled from a Source. Fabra supports many
different destinations, including data warehouses like BigQuery, Snowflake and Redshift, operational databases
like PostgreSQL and MySQL, and your own custom webhook endpoints.

## Connecting a Destination
The easiest way to setup a new Destination is to use Fabra's [Admin Panel](https://app.fabra.io). Navigate to the
Destinations tab on the side navigation bar, and click **New Destination** in the top right of the page.

<Note>
You can also use Fabra's API to create Objects instead. Check out our
[API docs](https://docs.fabra.io/api-reference/create-destination) to learn more.
