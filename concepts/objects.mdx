## What is an Object?

**Objects** define the structure of the data you expect from your customers: the fields/columns and their types.
You can configure as many different objects as you want. Some example Objects include `Events`, `Users`, `Organizations`,
and `Cohorts`.

## Creating an Object
The easiest way to setup a new Object is to use Fabra's [Admin Panel](https://app.fabra.io). Navigate to the Objects tab on
the side navigation bar, and click **New Object** in the top right of the page.
<Note>
You can also use Fabra's API to create Objects instead. Check out our [API docs](/api-reference/create-object)
to learn more.
