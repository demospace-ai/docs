## Webhook Destinations

You can configure Fabra to send your customer's data to your own **webhook** instead of loading data directly into a data warehouse.
To do so, Fabra will make a `POST` request to the webhook URL you enter when setting up the webhook destination with the following
payload structure:
```json
{
    "end_customer_id": 1,
    "object_name": "events", // configured when creating the object in Fabra
    "data": [
        {
            // these fields are configured when creating the object
            "object_field_1": "abc",
            "object_field_2": 1200,
            "object_field_3": ["list", "of", "anything"],
            "object_field_3": {"key": "value"},
            ...
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

The `data` field will be limited to a maximum length of 10,000 records per-request. For updates exceeding this limit (including the initial sync),
Fabra will make multiple calls to your webhook.

## JSON Fields

When configuring an object to receive via a webhook, you can indicate that a field should be `json`. Your customer will be able to add any number
of arbitrary key/value pairs to this object, and they will be collected into a single object when Fabra calls your webhook.

## Sync Modes

For webhooks, Fabra supports two different sync modes:
1. `full_overwrite`: Fabra will send every record on each sync
2. `incremental_append`: Fabra will only send the records that have been added or changed`
