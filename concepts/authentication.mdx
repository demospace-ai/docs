To authenticate requests with Fabra, you must include your `apiKey` in the
`X-API-KEY` header of HTTP requests made to the platform. You can obtain your API
key in the **API Keys** tab.

## Link Token / Access Token Exchange
When interacting with customer-created sources, you will need to authenticate using an access token. The following process ensures your customer credentials are handled in a safe manner.
| Step |    Action
| -----| -----------------------------------------------------
| `1`  | Your server calls `POST /link/token` to get a `linkToken`. The `linkToken` is a temporary token used by Fabra Connect to let customers create a sync.
| `2`  | Pass the `linkToken` to Fabra Connect. In the `onSuccess` handler, Fabra will return a temporary `publicToken`. The `onSuccess` handler is called after a customer successfully creates a sync.
| `3`  | Call `/link/exchange` with the `publicToken` and exchange it for a permanent `accessToken`.
| `4`  | Store the `accessToken` in a secure location (encrypted if possible). You will use it with your `apiKey` to interact with the account.
