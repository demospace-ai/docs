## What is a Source?

**Sources** are the databases or data warehouses *from* which data will be transferred. Fabra supports many
different sources, including BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, and more.

## Connecting a Source
The easiest way to start letting your customers connect their Sources is to use our Fabra Connect UI component.
You can read the guide on [setting up Fabra Connect](https://docs.fabra.io/guides/fabra-connect) to get started.

If you want to build your own UI, you can use Fabra's API to create Sources instead. Fabra requires different
inputs and permissions depending on what source you are using. Check out our
[API docs](https://docs.fabra.io/api-reference/create-source) to learn more.

Here's what your customers will see when they go to create a new Source:
