## Before You Start 

Make sure that you have already set up a dedicated `User` and `Role` for your Desintation Provider to access your Snowflake data warehouse.

### Example User/Role Creation Template
```sql
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS <your_role>;
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS <your_user> PASSWORD=********;

GRANT ROLE <your_role> TO ROLE SYSADMIN;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE <your_warehouse> TO ROLE <your_role>;
GRANT ROLE <your_role> TO USER <your_user>;

GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE <your_db> TO ROLE <your_role>;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE <your_db> TO ROLE <your_role>;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE <your_db> TO ROLE <your_role>;
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE <your_db> TO ROLE <your_role>;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE <your_db> TO ROLE <your_role>;
```

## How do I Set Up Snowflake as a Source?

### Connect a Source

1. Log in to your Desintation App.
2. Navigate to integrations. 
3. Click **New Sync**.
4. Choose **Snowflake**.
5. Input the following details:
    - **Display Name**: A descriptive, human-readable name for this data source
    - **Username**: This can be your personal username or you can create a dedicated user for syncing
    - **Password**: The password for your syncing user
    - **Database Name**: The name of the Snowflake database to sync from
    - **Warehouse Name**: The name of the warehouse used to run syncs in Snowflake
    - **Role**: The role name used to run syncs
    - **Host**: Your [Snowflake url](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier) (e.g., `abc123.us-east1.gcp.snowflakecomputing.com`) 
6. Click **Test** to validate the connection.
7. Click **Continue**.

### Choose a Syncing Data Model

1. Select a conversion object for your pulled data. These are pre-defined by your Desintation App to match the shape of their data.
2. Select a table to pull data from by providing the following information:
    - **Namespace**: The dataset ID within your poject (e.g., `my-namespace` in `project-name.my-namespace`)
    - **Table**: The name of the table in your namespace that you want to pull data from. The columns in this table are used to map to the conversion object.
3. Select **Preview** to see a sample of your table's imported data.
4. Click **Continue**.

### Map Fields

For each field in your imported table, map it to an equivalent from the chosen Syncing Data Model.
