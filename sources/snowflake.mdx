## Before You Start 

Make sure that you have already set up a dedicated `User` and `Role` for our syncing service to access your Snowflake data warehouse.

### Example User/Role Creation Template
```sql
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS <your_role>;
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS <your_user> PASSWORD=********;

GRANT ROLE <your_role> TO ROLE SYSADMIN;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE <your_warehouse> TO ROLE <your_role>;
GRANT ROLE <your_role> TO USER <your_user>;

GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE <your_db> TO ROLE <your_role>;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE <your_db> TO ROLE <your_role>;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE <your_db> TO ROLE <your_role>;
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE <your_db> TO ROLE <your_role>;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE <your_db> TO ROLE <your_role>;
```

## How do I Set Up Snowflake as a Source?

### Connect a Source

1. Log in to your Desintation App.
2. Navigate to the integrations portal.
3. Click **New Sync**.
4. Choose **Snowflake**.
5. Input the following details:
    - **Display Name**: A descriptive, human-readable name for this data source
    - **Username**: This can be your personal username or you can create a dedicated user for syncing
    - **Password**: The password for your syncing user
    - **Database Name**: The name of the Snowflake database to sync from
    - **Warehouse Name**: The name of the warehouse used to run syncs in Snowflake
    - **Role**: The role name used to run syncs
    - **Host**: Your [Snowflake url](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier) (e.g., `abc123.us-east1.gcp.snowflakecomputing.com`) 
6. Click **Test** to validate the connection.
7. Click **Continue**.

### Choose an Object to sync

1. Select an Object you want to create in the Destination App from your pulled data. The Object describes the expected format of the data in the Destination App.
2. Select a table to pull data from by providing the following information:
    - **Namespace**: The dataset ID within your poject (e.g., `my-namespace` in `project-name.my-namespace`)
    - **Table**: The name of the table in your namespace that you want to pull data from. The columns in this table will be mapped to the Object you selected.
3. Select **Preview** to see a sample of your table's data.
4. Click **Continue**.

### Map Fields

For each field of the chosen Object, select one of the columns in your source table to map to it.
