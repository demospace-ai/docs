## Before You Start 

Make sure that you have already set up a dedicated [Google Service Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) for our syncing service that has the `BigQuery Data Editor` and `BigQuery Job User` roles. You'll also need to create and download a JSON key.

## How do I Set Up BigQuery as a Source?

### Connect a Source

1. Log in to your Desintation App.
2. Navigate to the integrations portal.
3. Click **New Sync**.
4. Choose **BigQuery**.
5. Input the following details:
    1. **Display Name**: A descriptive, human-readable name for this data source
    1. **Location**: The geographic location of your datasets (e.g.,`us-east1`)
    1. **Service Account Key**: A `JSON` object downloaded from [Google Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) when you create a new key for your project.
6. Click **Test** to validate the connection.
7. Click **Continue**.

### Choose an Object to sync

1. Select an Object you want to create in the Destination App from your pulled data. The Object describes the expected format of the data in the Destination App.
2. Select a table to pull data from by providing the following information:
    1. **Namespace**: The dataset ID within your poject (e.g., `my-namespace` in `project-name.my-namespace`)
    1. **Table**: The name of the table in your namespace that you want to pull data from. The columns in this table will be mapped to the Object you selected.
3. Select **Preview** to see a sample of your table's data.
4. Click **Continue**.

### Map Fields

For each field of the chosen Object, select one of the columns in your source table to map to it.
