## Before You Start 

Make sure that you have already set up a dedicated [Google Service Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) for your project that has the `BigQuery Data Editor` and `BigQuery Job User` roles. You'll also need to create and download a JSON key.

## How do I Set Up BigQuery as a Source?

### Connect a Source

1. Log in to your Desintation App.
2. Navigate to integrations. 
3. Click **New Sync**.
4. Choose **BigQuery**.
5. Input the following details:
    - **Display Name**: A descriptive, human-readable name for this data source
    - **Location**: The geographic location of your datasets (e.g.,`us-east1`)
    - **Service Account Key**: A `JSON` object downloaded from [Google Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) when you create a new key for your project.
6. Click **Test** to validate the connection.
7. Click **Continue**.

### Choose a Syncing Data Model

1. Select a conversion object for your pulled data. These are pre-defined by your Desintation App to match the shape of their data.
2. Select a table to pull data from by providing the following information:
    - **Namespace**: The dataset ID within your poject (e.g., `my-namespace` in `project-name.my-namespace`)
    - **Table**: The name of the table in your namespace that you want to pull data from. The columns in this table are used to map to the conversion object.
3. Select **Preview** to see a sample of your table's imported data.
4. Click **Continue**.

### Map Fields

For each field in your imported table, map it to an equivalent from the chosen Syncing Data Model.
