## Before You Start 

Make sure that you have already set up a dedicated user for our syncing service to access your Azure Synapse database. 

### Example User/Role Creation Template

```sql 
CREATE LOGIN <your_login> WITH PASSWORD = '********';
CREATE USER <your_user FOR LOGIN <your_login>;  

-- Add the user to a database role
ALTER ROLE [db_datareader] ADD MEMBER <your_user>;

-- or grant access to a specific table
GRANT SELECT ON <your_table> TO <your_user>;  
```

6. Click **Test** to validate the connection.

### Choose an Object to sync

1. Select an Object you want to create in the Destination App from your pulled data. The Object describes the expected format of the data in the Destination App.
2. Select a table to pull data from by providing the following information:
    - **Namespace**: The dataset ID within your poject (e.g., `my-namespace` in `project-name.my-namespace`)
    - **Table**: The name of the table in your namespace that you want to pull data from. The columns in this table will be mapped to the Object you selected.
3. Select **Preview** to see a sample of your table's data.
4. Click **Continue**.

### Map Fields

For each field of the chosen Object, select one of the columns in your source table to map to it.
