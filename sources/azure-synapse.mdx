## Before You Start 

Make sure that you have already set up a dedicated user for your Desintation Provider to access your Azure Synapse  database. 

### Example User/Role Creation Template

```sql 
CREATE LOGIN <your_login> WITH PASSWORD = '********';
CREATE USER <your_user FOR LOGIN <your_login>;  

-- Add the user to a database role
ALTER ROLE [db_datareader] ADD MEMBER <your_user>;

-- or grant access to a specific table
GRANT SELECT ON <your_table> TO <your_user>;  
```

## How do I Set Up BigQuery as a Source?

### Connect a Source

1. Log in to your Desintation App.
2. Navigate to integrations. 
3. Click **New Sync**.
4. Choose **Azure Synapse**.
5. Input the following details:
    - **Display Name**: A descriptive, human-readable name for this data source
    - **Username**: This can be your personal username or you can create a dedicated user for syncing
    - **Password**: The password for your syncing user
    - **Database Name**: The name of the Redshift database to sync from
    - **Endpoint**: The endpoint URL used to sync
6. Click **Test** to validate the connection.
7. Click **Continue**.

### Choose a Syncing Data Model

1. Select a conversion object for your pulled data. These are pre-defined by your Desintation App to match the shape of their data.
2. Select a table to pull data from by providing the following information:
    - **Namespace**: The dataset ID within your poject (e.g., `my-namespace` in `project-name.my-namespace`)
    - **Table**: The name of the table in your namespace that you want to pull data from. The columns in this table are used to map to the conversion object.
3. Select **Preview** to see a sample of your table's imported data.
4. Click **Continue**.

### Map Fields

For each field in your imported table, map it to an equivalent from the chosen Syncing Data Model.
