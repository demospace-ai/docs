## Before You Start 

Make sure that you have already set up a dedicated user for your Desintation Provider to access your MongoDB database. 

### Example User/Role Creation Template

```js
db.createUser({
  user: "your_user",
  pwd: "********",
  roles:[{role: "read" , db:"your_database"}]
});
```

## How do I Set Up MongoDB as a Source?

### Connect a Source

1. Log in to your Destination Provider (e.g., *Custify*).
2. Navigate to integrations. 
3. Click **New Sync**.
4. Choose **MongoDB**.
5. Input the following details:
    - **Display Name**: A descriptive, human-readable name for this data source
    - **Username**: This can be your personal username or you can create a dedicated user for syncing
    - **Password**: The password for your syncing user
    - **Host**: Your MongoDB URL used to sync
    - **Connection Options**: Add any optional additional connection configuration here.
6. Click **Test** to validate the connection.
7. Click **Continue**.

### Choose a Syncing Data Model

1. Select a conversion object for your pulled data. These are pre-defined by your Destination Provider to match the shape of their data.
2. Select a table to pull data from by providing the following information:
    - **Namespace**: The dataset ID within your poject (e.g., `my-namespace` in `project-name.my-namespace`)
    - **Table**: The name of the table in your namespace that you want to pull data from. The columns in this table are used to map to the conversion object.
3. Select **Preview** to see a sample of your table's imported data.
4. Click **Continue**.

### Map Fields

For each field in your imported table, map it to an equivalent from the chosen Syncing Data Model.
