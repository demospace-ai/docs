With Fabra, it's easy to start syncing data with your customer's data warehouse. You can
offer native integrations with every data warehouse in minutes by using
[Fabra Connect](/guides/fabra-connect), our pre-built UI component.
Or if you prefer, you can develop your own interface by calling
our [API](/api-reference) behind-the-scenes.
