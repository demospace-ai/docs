## Welcome to Fabra!

Fabra is a platform to help companies build **customer-facing data warehouse integrations**.

Fabra makes it easy to start ingesting data from your customer's data warehouse. You can use
[Fabra Connect](https://docs.fabra.io/guides/fabra-connect), our pre-built UI component, or
develop your own interface by calling our [API endpoints](https://docs.fabra.io/api-reference)
behind-the-scenes.
