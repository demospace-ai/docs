Fabra Connect is a UI component that your users will interact with in order to setup their data sourec
connections and start syncing data into your system.

To get started with Fabra Connect, follow the steps below.

## High-Level Overview
Here are the steps to add Fabra Connect into your application:
1. Create a `link_token` by calling the [Create Link Token endpoint](https://docs.fabra.io/api-reference/create-link-token)
1. Use the **Fabra Connect SDK** to initialize Fabra Connect with the `link_token`

## Create a Link Token
In your backend, set up a `POST` request to initialize a Connect session and get a `link_token` from Fabra's 
[Create Link Token endpoint](https://docs.fabra.io/api-reference/create-link-token).

Make sure to include the `end_customer_id`, which identifies the customer in *your own system*. When Fabra performs
a sync for this customer, it will include this ID in every row that it loads into your system.

You'll want to create an endpoint in your backend to perform this creation on demand. Here's an example of how that
would look in a Node backend:

```javascript
app.post("/link-token", async (req, res) => {
  const response = await fetch("https://app.fabra.io/api/link_token", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "X_API_TOKEN": process.env.FABRA_API_TOKEN,
    },
  });

  const body = await response.json();
  res.send({ link_token: body.link_token });
});
```

## Initialize Fabra Connect
First, install the Fabra Connect SDK in your frontend:
```
npm install --save @fabra/react-fabra-connect
```

In your frontend, initialize Fabra Connect on the page where you want to render the component:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useFabraConnect } from "@fabra/react-fabra-connect";

const App = () => {
  const { open } = useFabraConnect();
  const linkToken = fetchLinkToken(); // Use the API you created in Step 1 here

  return (
    <button onClick={() => open(linkToken)}>
      Open Fabra Connect
    </button>
  );
};
```
