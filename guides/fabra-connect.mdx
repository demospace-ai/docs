**Fabra Connect** is a UI component that your users will interact with in order to setup their data source
connections and start syncing data into your system.

To get started with Fabra Connect, follow the steps below.

## High-Level Overview

Here are the steps to add Fabra Connect into your application:

1. Create a `link_token` by calling the [Create Link Token endpoint](/api-reference/create-link-token)
1. Use the **Fabra Connect SDK** to initialize Fabra Connect with the `link_token`

## Create a Link Token

<Snippet file="create-link-token.mdx" />

## Initialize Fabra Connect

<Snippet file="fabra-connect.mdx" />

## Styling

Fabra currently supports customizing the color used in the Fabra Connect component. To do so, just pass in an object when
calling `useFabraConnect`:

```javascript
const { open } = useFabraConnect({
  customTheme:{
    colors: {
      primary: {
        base: #805AD5, // Primary color for buttons, graphics, etc.
        hover: #553C9A, // Hover color for buttons and links
        text: #FFFFFF, // The font color on top of the primary color
      }
    }
  }
});
```
