## 1. Setup a Fabra Account
1. Login or create an account in [Fabra](app.fabra.io).
1. Setup your organization.
1. (Optional) Invite team members

## 2. Setup a Destination
In Fabra's [Admin Panel](https://app.fabra.io), navigate to the `Destinations` tab on the side navigation bar, and
click **New Destination** in the top right of the page.

</Frame>

## 3. Create an Object
In Fabra's [Admin Panel](https://app.fabra.io), navigate to the `Objects` tab on the side navigation bar, and
click **New Object** in the top right of the page. Choose one of the Destinations you have configured from [Step 1](#1-setup-a-destination)
and select the [namespace](/concepts/namespaces) and [table](/concepts/tables) where Fabra should
load data into for this object.

Fabra will pull the existing fields/columns from your selected table, and you can then use those to define the fields you expect from your
customers. If you want to omit a field, simply check the `omit` checkbox and Fabra will not prompt your customers for that field. Make sure
to provide helpful display names and descriptions, since these will be what your customers see.

## 4. Add Fabra Connect to your frontend
Fabra Connect is a UI component that your users will interact with in order to setup their data source connections and start syncing data
into your system. Getting setup is only two easy steps.
<h3 style={{"marginTop": "24px"}}>Create a Link Token</h3>
In your backend, set up a `POST` request to initialize a Connect session and get a `link_token` from Fabra's 
[Create Link Token endpoint](/api-reference/create-link-token).

Make sure to include the `end_customer_id`, which identifies the customer in *your own system*. When Fabra performs
a sync for this customer, it will include this ID in every row that it loads into your system.

You'll want to create an endpoint in your backend to perform this creation on demand. Here's an example of how that
would look in a Node backend:

```javascript
app.post("/link-token", async (req, res) => {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.fabra.io/link_token", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "X_API_TOKEN": process.env.FABRA_API_TOKEN,
    },
  });

  const body = await response.json();
  res.send({ link_token: body.link_token });
});
```

<h3> Initialize Fabra Connect</h3>
First, install the Fabra Connect SDK in your frontend:
```
npm install --save @fabra/react-fabra-connect
```

In your frontend, initialize Fabra Connect on the page where you want to render the component:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useFabraConnect } from "@fabra/react-fabra-connect";

const App = () => {
  const { open } = useFabraConnect();
  const linkToken = fetchLinkToken(); // Use the API you created in Step 1 here

  return (
    <button onClick={() => open(linkToken)}>
      Open Fabra Connect
    </button>
  );
};
```
