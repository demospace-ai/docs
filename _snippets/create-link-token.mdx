In your backend, set up a `POST` request to initialize a Connect session and get a `link_token` from Fabra's 
[Create Link Token endpoint](/api-reference/create-link-token).

Make sure to include the `end_customer_id`, which identifies the customer in *your own system*. When Fabra performs
a sync for this customer, it will include this ID in every row that it loads into your system.

You'll want to create an endpoint in your backend to perform this creation on demand. Here's an example of how that
would look in a Node backend:

```javascript
app.post("/link-token", async (req, res) => {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.fabra.io/link_token", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "X-API-KEY": process.env.FABRA_API_KEY,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({end_customer_id: "abcd-1234-efgh-5678"})
  });

  const body = await response.json();
  res.send({ link_token: body.link_token });
});
```
